# Electricity Consumption Analysis with Python

This project is part of a practical scenario-based assessment focused on analyzing household electricity consumption trends across different regions in Singapore. The analysis was developed in Python, strictly using raw data from a CSV file without external preprocessing tools.

## 🔍 Scenario Overview

You are given a dataset (`AvgHouseHoldElectricity.csv`) containing electricity consumption data between **2010 and 2023**. The objective is to help the **Marketing Director** derive useful insights from the last five years (2019–2023) based on user-specified months.

## 📌 Features & Deliverables

- 📅 **User input for month selection** (1–12)
- 📊 **Tabular summary** of average consumption per region by year
- 📈 **Insight generation**:
  - Max, Min, Average, and Range per region
  - Max, Min, Average per year
- 🔁 **Looping functionality** for repeated analysis
- ➕ **Bonus analysis** (value-added feature):
  - Per-region statistics: Mean, Std Dev, Q1, Median, Q3

## 📁 Files

- `S6G3_5_N2401038J_Mth_yr_Region.py`: Main Python script for running the analysis.
- `AvgHouseHoldElectricity.csv`: Dataset file containing the raw electricity consumption data.
